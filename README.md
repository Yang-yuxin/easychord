# EasyChord
This is a webpage designed for learners of harmony and music theory. 
It helps users experiment with chords and develop the ability to distinguish them.
The grid positioning of chords follows the music theory lesson developed by Seth Monahan (https://www.youtube.com/c/SethMonahan).

The pianovisualizer and code framework followed https://github.com/michaelnew/web-piano as reference.
